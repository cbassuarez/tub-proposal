      "description": "THE TUB is a floor-bound acrylic prism that listens, remembers, and plays back with you. Visitors plug in instruments or devices and shape the system’s behavior with industrial Allen-Bradley switches. Inside the tub, a small computer analyzes the shared sound field and answers through a multi-speaker array, treating the gallery as a co-produced instrument.",
