A ring of speakers surrounds you, with industrial Allen-Bradley switches on short pedestals between the entrance and the tub. Visitors may plug in instruments, phones, or microphones, or simply speak into the space; the tub listens, remembers, and replies in moving multichannel sound, turning the gallery into a shared, slowly learning instrument.",

It shapes how the tub behaves as an accompanist, how it moves sound through the WaveCave, and how it regulates its own energy over the span of a week-long installation.",
