A ring of speakers surrounds you, with industrial Allen-Bradley switches on short pedestals between the entrance and the tub. Visitors may plug in instruments, phones, or microphones, or simply speak into the space; the tub listens, remembers, and replies in moving multichannel sound, turning the gallery into a shared, slowly learning instrument.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2 id=\"detailed-description\">Detailed Description\u003c/h2>\u003cp>THE TUB is a cybernetic, spatiodynamic sculpture that treats a single acrylic prism and the gallery around it as a listening instrument. Constructed from welded 1/2&quot; frosted acrylic panels braced with clear blocks, the tub sits directly on the floor, like a bathtub extruded from the concrete. It houses a small computer, audio interface, and cabling that route sound to a six-channel speaker field and out to a line of Allen-Bradley selector switches on metal pedestals.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Visitors can connect instruments, microphones, or phones to labeled inputs, or let an always-on contact microphone mounted to the tub pick up their voice, touch, and the general room noise. A custom software patch analyzes these inputs in real time, tracking loudness, gesture density, spectral brightness, and broad pitch regions. Rather than “recognizing” material, the system uses these features to steer its own behavior: how dense it may become, how synthetic or acoustic it sounds, and how it moves through the speakers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Allen-Bradley switches expose this temperament. One switch shapes spatial form (tight, orbiting, or fragmented trajectories); another toggles the tub’s persona (shadowing, partnering, or disrupting the player); a third governs memory, from almost blank to long-term recall of earlier sessions; a fourth leans the sound toward resonant, hybrid, or clearly electronic textures. Visitors learn these states through use rather than instruction, discovering that the piece is legible but never entirely predictable.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The WaveCave is an ideal site because its existing six-channel ceiling system and flexible architecture already frame sound as something that inhabits the room rather than the stage. THE TUB extends that logic by making the gallery’s infrastructure visible: cables cross the floor from the tub to the pedestals and from the control room to the speaker ring, foregrounding the room as a circuit. The work aligns with the WaveCave’s emphasis on experimental sound installations rather than one-off performances: there is no single fixed concert, only a week of evolving encounters between people, architecture, and a machine that gradually accumulates history.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Technically, the installation is straightforward and self-contained. I will bring the tub, pedestals, all switching hardware, the LOM BasicUcho contact microphone, a laptop, and an audio interface. The system feeds the WaveCave’s Lynx Aurora and six Genelec ceiling speakers, respecting the existing wiring and projector layout. Once tuned, the patch runs continuously for the entire Sunday–Saturday run, requiring only simple daily procedures for power-up, verification, and shut-down.\u003c/p>\n","fm":{}},{"id":"docs/research","path":"docs/research.md","url":"#/docs/research","title":"Research Context, Bio & Links","summary":"THE TUB is part of my ongoing research into cybernetics, spatial production, and machine agency in sound.

A Caracas-born Venezuelan-American artist, their dialectic output is derived from the ablation of established performance practice, injecting elements of spontaneity, irreverence, and profane action into their works wherever possible (as in their prepared harpsichord solo Seven Sounds for Strings). \u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Be it a 15’ scrolling-cell-score-video-game-music tapestry, a concerto for film cameras, sonic sculptures, paintings, MaxMSP patches, video installations, or countless, countless noise sets, Sebastian has their hands in many forms of expression. As a performer, they have recently been playing drum set, amplified bass viola da gamba, prepared guitar, harpsichord (prepared and otherwise), and laptop, focusing on free improvisation, fluxus performance, and low-fidelity methods of amplification.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Sebastian recently completed their masters in music composition at the Peabody Institute of The Johns Hopkins University under Sky Macklay, Oscar Bettison, Michael Hersch, and Felipe Lara. They have recently worked with ensembles like Parker Quartet, Mivos Quartet, Ensemble Dal Niente, Alexandre Ribeiro, Trio Immersio, Estrella Consort, TORCH Collective, among other groups and personal commissions.
