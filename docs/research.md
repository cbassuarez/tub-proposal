# Research Context, Bio & Links

THE TUB is part of my ongoing research into cybernetics, spatial production, and machine agency in sound. Across recent works I have treated technological systems as performers with their own limited but persistent forms of memory, temperament, and refusal. The piece extends that practice into an explicitly public gallery setting.

This work extends conversations in cybernetics and spatial dynamics, being and phenomenology, and the production of space begun by Schöffer, Kac and Nakamura, and Eliasson. These artists, which I have chosen as clear exemplars of the craft, are written about extensively in my doctoral dissertation/topic driven research. As such, THE TUB is necessarily derivative of works like *CYSP 1* (1956), *Essay Concerning Human Understanding* (1994), and *Room For One Colour* (1997) 

The work also sits alongside my streetlight sculptures, optics-driven performance systems, and other installations that treat industrial materials and signal-processing pipelines as collaborators rather than tools. WaveCave’s context—as an experimental sound gallery within the Herb Alpert School of Music—makes it an ideal site for this strand of research to be experienced by a broader student and faculty audience.

## Artist Bio

Sebastian Suarez-Solis (b. 1999) is a sonic and visual artist whose works range from musical compositions to visual pieces, installations, performances, and happenings. A Caracas-born Venezuelan-American artist, their dialectic output is derived from the ablation of established performance practice, injecting elements of spontaneity, irreverence, and profane action into their works wherever possible (as in their prepared harpsichord solo Seven Sounds for Strings). 

Be it a 15’ scrolling-cell-score-video-game-music tapestry, a concerto for film cameras, sonic sculptures, paintings, MaxMSP patches, video installations, or countless, countless noise sets, Sebastian has their hands in many forms of expression. As a performer, they have recently been playing drum set, amplified bass viola da gamba, prepared guitar, harpsichord (prepared and otherwise), and laptop, focusing on free improvisation, fluxus performance, and low-fidelity methods of amplification.

Sebastian recently completed their masters in music composition at the Peabody Institute of The Johns Hopkins University under Sky Macklay, Oscar Bettison, Michael Hersch, and Felipe Lara. They have recently worked with ensembles like Parker Quartet, Mivos Quartet, Ensemble Dal Niente, Alexandre Ribeiro, Trio Immersio, Estrella Consort, TORCH Collective, among other groups and personal commissions. They are a co-founder of Dex Digital Sample Library, an online, open-access collection of Creative Commons commissioned recordings.
