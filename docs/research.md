## Research Context

THE TUB is part of my ongoing research into cybernetics, spatial production, and machine agency in sound. Across recent works I have treated technological systems as performers with their own limited but persistent forms of memory, temperament, and refusal. The piece extends that practice into an explicitly public gallery setting.

In my doctoral dissertation at CalArts, *EMBODIED MANIFESTATIONS of SPACE*, I argue that space is produced through feedback between bodies, architectures, and technological systems, not merely a neutral container. THE TUB puts that argument into practice: the room’s sound field emerges from a feedback loop among visitors’ actions, the tub’s internal listening and decision-making, and the WaveCave’s architectural and technical infrastructure.

The work also sits alongside my streetlight sculptures, optics-driven performance systems, and other installations that treat industrial materials and signal-processing pipelines as collaborators rather than tools. WaveCave’s context—as an experimental sound gallery within the Herb Alpert School of Music—makes it an ideal site for this strand of research to be experienced by a broader student and faculty audience.

## Artist Bio (≤200 words)

Sebastian Suarez-Solis (b. 1999, Caracas) is a Venezuelan-American composer, performer, and visual artist whose practice moves between sound installation, experimental music, and technology-driven sculpture. Their work often retools everyday infrastructures—streetlights, tubs, score readers, optical systems—into instruments that listen back and act with some degree of autonomy.

They have created pieces for chamber ensembles, solo performers, and self-built systems, working with groups such as Mivos Quartet, Parker Quartet, Ensemble Dal Niente, and various improvising collectives. Recent projects include kinetic light works, cybernetic percussion environments, and open-access recording initiatives.  

Sebastian is currently completing a DMA in music at the California Institute of the Arts, where their research focuses on cybernetics, spatial production, and technologies of accompaniment. They are a co-founder of Dex Digital Sample Library, an online Creative Commons collection of commissioned recordings, and maintain an active practice as a drummer, guitarist, and laptop performer.
