# Safety, Accessibility & Risk Notes

## Structural Safety

- The tub is constructed from 1/2" acrylic with additional clear blocks reinforcing the interior joints and optional top trusses. It is designed to withstand incidental contact and the weight of people lightly leaning on or resting against it.
- While the tub could physically support a seated person, signage and wall text will clearly discourage sitting or climbing.
- The object rests directly on the floor; nothing is hung from the ceiling or walls, minimizing load and fall risk.

If CalArts Risk Management needs documentation on materials or construction, I can supply acrylic specifications and sketches in advance.

## Sound Levels

- The system will be calibrated to operate at comfortable levels appropriate for long-duration listening.
- Hard limiting and density management in the patch prevent unexpected extreme spikes.
- If sound temporarily needs to be disabled (e.g., for piano tuning in ROD), the control-room quick guide will show how to mute or power down the tub system in a single step.

## Cables & Trip Hazards

- All floor cables between the tub, pedestals, and control room will be taped down or routed through cable ramps, especially in high-traffic zones near the entrance.
- Pedestals are placed to allow clear walkways around and between them, including space for wheelchair users and mobility devices.

## Light & Visual Comfort

- The tub’s internal lighting is soft and static or slowly changing—no strobes or rapid flicker patterns.
- If any visual feedback is added (e.g., LEDs on pedestals), it will avoid high-frequency flashing.

## Accessibility & Wayfinding

- Wall text will use clear, straightforward language explaining that visitors are invited (but not required) to:
  - Plug in devices,
  - Touch / play the tub,
  - Manipulate the switches,
  - Or simply listen.
- A short note will warn that the gallery contains amplified sound and may not be suitable for visitors with extreme sound sensitivity.
- Switches will be reachable from a standing or seated position where possible, avoiding unnecessary height.

## Compliance with WaveCave Guidelines

The piece respects the core WaveCave guidelines:

- It is a sound installation oriented around week-long gallery presence, not a single performance event.
- All projectors remain in their default positions; I do not move or repoint them.
- Any necessary approvals (e.g., for materials, volume level, or reception) will be processed through the standard CalArts event and risk management forms in consultation with the WaveCave TA and faculty director.
