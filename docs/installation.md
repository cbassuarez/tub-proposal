# Installation Plan, Timeline & Maintenance

## Overall Schedule

The installation follows the WaveCave’s standard week-long schedule:

- **Sunday:** Install, calibration, and stress-testing.
- **Monday–Friday:** Open gallery hours with the work running continuously.
- **Saturday:** Final open hours, documentation, and de-install.

The system is designed to run unattended during most open hours, with periodic check-ins from me or a designated assistant.

## Installation Day (Sunday)

**Morning / Early Afternoon**

- Load-in tub, pedestals, electronics, and cabling.
- Place tub in the agreed location (center or slight offset, depending on other spatial needs).
- Position pedestals between entrance and tub, confirming clear walkways and accessibility.

**Afternoon**

- Patch audio from my interface into the Lynx Aurora and confirm proper routing to all speakers.
- Attach the contact microphone and test gain staging to avoid feedback.
- Wire all Allen-Bradley switches and verify state updates in the patch.
- Map behaviors to the speaker layout and perform initial tuning (levels, density limits, safety).

**Evening**

- Run 1–2 hours of continuous test operation to confirm stability.
- Create and print a one-page “Control Room Quick Guide” explaining:
  - Power-up sequence.
  - Mute / on-off procedure.
  - Who to contact if something behaves unexpectedly.

## Daily Operation (Mon–Sat)

Each day requires a short routine:

1. **Power-up (5–10 minutes)**
   - Turn on the WaveCave system as usual.
   - Power on the tub system via the labeled strip.
   - Verify audio output from the tub into all six speakers at moderate level.
   - Confirm switch state updates are visible to the patch.

2. **Midday Check (optional)**
   - Confirm no cables have been kicked loose.
   - Scan for any unexpected behavior or clipping.

3. **Shut-down (5 minutes)**
   - Use the patch’s “soft stop” function to fade activity to silence.
   - Power down the tub strip.
   - Shut down laptop or quit the patch if running on the WaveCave computer.

Where possible, I will handle these tasks personally. If conflict arises, I will train one trusted colleague and/or a TA with clear written instructions.

## De-installation (Saturday)

- Power down and disconnect all tub electronics.
- Remove the tub and pedestals from the space.
- Carefully lift tape, cable ramps, and any temporary floor markings.
- Coil and remove all personal cabling.
- Restore the control room to its default audio routing.
- Spackle and paint any small screw holes created by pedestals (if applicable), using WaveCave-provided materials.

The goal is to leave the WaveCave in equal or better condition than at load-in.

## Documentation

Throughout the week I will collect:

- High-resolution photographs of the tub, the overall room, and visitors interacting with the work.
- Short audio recordings and, if permitted, video excerpts of interaction sessions.

After the run, I will provide the requested documentation bundle (1–5 images, a concise description, and links) to the WaveCave TAs for inclusion on the WaveCave website.
