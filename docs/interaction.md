# Audience Experience & Interaction

## Entering the Space

From the hallway, visitors see a frosted acrylic tub resting on the floor, lit softly from within. Cables emerge from one side of the tub and cross the floor toward a short line of metal pedestals holding Allen-Bradley switches. Above, the familiar WaveCave ceiling grid hides a 6-channel speaker system that quietly fills the room.

A small wall text outside the gallery explains that visitors are invited to plug in, touch the tub, and manipulate the switches.

## What Visitors Can Do

Inside the gallery, people may:

- Plug an instrument, microphone, or phone into clearly labeled jacks.
- Play toward the tub with acoustic sound alone, letting the contact mic pick up their gestures.
- Walk around the room to hear how their sound and the tub’s responses shift in space.
- Experiment with one or more selector switches, slowly exploring how different states shape behavior.

There is no “start button.” The tub is always listening and always ready to answer.

## How the Tub Responds

The system’s behavior is designed to be:

- **Clearly responsive** – changes in loudness, texture, and rhythm are audibly reflected in the space.
- **Learnable** – spending time with a particular switch configuration reveals consistent tendencies.
- **Never fully transparent** – stochastic choices and hidden state prevent full instrumental mastery.

Visitors notice that:

- In some switch positions the tub closely shadows them, almost like a delay with a mind of its own.
- In others it pushes back with disruptive or noisy gestures.
- Over longer visits, fragments of earlier material return in altered form.

## Week-Long Life of the Installation

Over a typical Sunday–Saturday run, the installation operates primarily as an open gallery work, not a fixed performance.

- **Daytime** – intermittent casual visitors, individual performers, and small groups generate a slow accumulation of sonic history in the system.
- **Evenings** – one or two announced sessions allow invited performers to work more intensively with the tub, but these remain in the frame of an installation: audiences are free to move, talk quietly, and enter/leave at will.

The system’s memory settings make each day’s activity subtly influence the next. The room gradually carries traces of the week’s interactions without ever collapsing into a fixed loop.

## Installation, Not Concert

At all times, THE TUB emphasizes the WaveCave’s identity as an experimental sound space, not a performance venue. There is no timeline of songs or video on autoplay. Instead, sound arises from the feedback loop among visitors, the room, and the machine, meeting the call’s priority on sound-based installation, experimentation, and feasibility.
